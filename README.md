   In this repository you gonna find the backend complement for the balance-app repo. I decide to advance with node.js 
   
    cors -> to avoid cors issues
    dotenv -> work with envoirenment variables to keep sensitive data
    express -> to integrate templates
    mysql2 -> to set de connection with db, in this case mysql
    swagger -> to simplify the manage of the api
